betterMouseover.js
==================

betterMouseover is a small jquery plugin which purpose is to avoid run some action on accidental mouseovering element.

For example, You are changing background image of some section while reading and hovering items in menu. In cases when the user is going too fast trought menu items, you probably don't want to transform your page into stroboscope :D. Also It looks nice and smooth when you use transitions, but they require some time to start and complete.

Using this plugin, you can avoid this behavior. User will go trought items and if he "stays" over any for a given amount of time, action will be fired. 

For tryout see my Fiddle:

Usage
-----

standard syntax is:

```$("trigger_element_or_multiple_of_them").betterMouseover(time_in_microseconds, function() { do_something... });```

example from fiddle:

```$("#col3, #col4").betterMouseover(500, function() {Â bla bla bla });```

Compatibility
-------------

It's really simple plugin for now. There should not be jQuery compatibility / browser related problems.
jQuery used in time of writing this plugin is on version 1.8.3
